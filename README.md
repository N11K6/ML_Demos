# Hello and Welcome

I guess that this repository can be considered my portfolio. 

I will be adding some short and perhaps some longer projects that I feel are indicative of my research interests and working methods.

As I am primarily a DSP and Machine Learning engineer, the projects included are all in this direction. Each subdirectory here corresponds to a separate project, which includes all the scripts and data necessary to run and replicate my results. In cases where data has not been uploaded on Github, download links are provided.

I have chosen the Jupyter Notebook format to showcase these projects for the following reasons:

  1. Markdown allows for clear and extensive comments on the code, helping the viewer understand the workflow.
  2. Each cell can be run individually, allowing for the viewer to monitor each step of the process.
  3. Python scripts often necessitate the use of multiple .py files to exist in the same directory in order to run properly. 
     A single .ipynb file can be downloaded and run from start to finish without the need of additional scripts (dependence on
     data that exists in specific directories notwithstanding). 
  4. One can run .ipynb files on various web apps that are freely available. This means you don't even need to have python installed
     in your machine to use the notebooks, as long as you can upload them to an online environment such as Google colab.
